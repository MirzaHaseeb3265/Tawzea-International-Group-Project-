# 💧 Tawzea International Group – KPI Performance Dashboard  
### Water & Wastewater Operations | Strategy & Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **data-driven Key Performance Indicator (KPI) framework** for **Tawzea International Group**, a leading water utility and wastewater service provider in Saudi Arabia.

The objective is to enhance **operational efficiency, resource utilization, service reliability, and customer satisfaction** through continuous performance monitoring across **Wastewater** and **RO (Reverse Osmosis) Water Plants**.

Founded in 2004, Tawzea operates across all **13 regions of the Kingdom**, delivering eco-friendly water distribution, wastewater treatment, and environmental services aligned with global quality standards. This KPI dashboard supports management in making **data-driven strategic and operational decisions**.
